(define (equ? n m)


  ;Now, eq? only checks same-type elements, therefore, we should implement eq?
  ;per type in their respective install file.
  ;And install this into the arithmetic package.
  
  (if (= (tag n) (tag m)) (eq? n m) #f)
  )

Just call equ? with parameters m = data, n = 0.
Again, it is upto the specific data types to implement what does it mean
to be zero, for a rational number it's its numerator = 0, for a complex
its magnitude = 0. and so on.

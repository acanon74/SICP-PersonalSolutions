Generic operations:
You ought to write the whole implementation for every new data type and operations.
As well as how the codebase interacts with the new implementations.

Data-directed style:
You only need to add the new implementation and data type to the look up table.
It is not necessary to change how the codebase interacts with this, since this will be accomplish
by standarized procedures relying on the look up table.

Message-passing style:
You will have to implement the new types and operations, inside every new class.
However, it is not necessary to change the codebase since it will rely on the initial
implementations inside the data types.

In this approach if we had two sequencial calls to exchange-serialized
we would put the exchange procedure in a serializer, and
inside it another serializer for the withdraw and deposit procecures.
Therefore withdraw and deposit calls from both calls of exchange
would be able to run concurrently, even though the exchange procedures
are actually running sequencially in their own serializer.

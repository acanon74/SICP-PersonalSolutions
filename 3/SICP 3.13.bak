;; My guess is that it will report now only the first item
;which was once the end of the list.
;this is because the last-pair, will return the last pair,
;including its car and cdr values, (which is a value and
;the nil character), and doesnt remove or add a proper
;nil property.

;Therefore once we move the last value, we take make
; the nil character the cdr of the whole list.
;at which point it ends. We lost access to the
;the whole list but the last (now first) item.

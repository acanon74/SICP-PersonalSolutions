# SICP-PersonalSolutions
Using lectures and notes available in MIT OpenCourseWare.
Started working on SICP with the objective of mastering the book as a precursor to CLRS. 
I began around mid 2022, finished in June 2023. 

I gained a lot of knowlegde from this book, specially sections 4 and 5, about evaluation of a programming language and how the machine works behind the scenes were incredible eye-opening. As a student of engineering, I had a superficial idea on how the computer actually interpret and operate code instructions and programs. But after reading SICP, I have gained much insight (and actually active interest) in parts such as the compiler and memory collection operations. 

I really recommend this book to computer science students and engineers who wish to learn more in depth about the processing and execution of programs by a machine. The book does not get boring at any point, in fact, something I loved was that just after eintroducing a concept using technical details, the book goes on to show the relevance of the concept by showing an example applicable to the day-to-day life of the reader. This is the case with the concurrency of time and baking systems, or the final topic, the interpretation of Lisp itself using evaluation procedures, registers machines and finally the compiler.

Besides the book itself, I invite other students to check some of the references mentioned throughout the book. Specially those in chapter 4 and 5, since they are about problems yet to be solved in modern day such as the unequivalence of pure mathematical logic and programming languages and how difference languages have different approches to the use of stack structures. I recommend, the following:

- Hanson, Christopher P. 1990. Efficient stack allocation for tail-recursive languages. In Proceedings of ACM Conference on Lisp and Functional Programming, pp. 106-118.
- Clark, Keith L. 1978. Negation as failure. In Logic and Data Bases. New York: Plenum Press, pp. 293-322

The following link contain additional resources used to study and as supporting material:

- http://community.schemewiki.org/?SICP-Solutions
- https://racket-lang.org/

Chapter 5 introduces many different concepts and it becomes hard to rewrite the codebase to eventually solve the exercises locally, therefore I recommend reading the code in the book, and then use the code templates available at https://sicp-solutions.net/ . These do not contain the solutions, they only copied what was written in the book.
